# PA-Voter-Analysis
7/6/2019

In this project we will run an analysis on voters by city in Pennsylvania. 

PA is considered a battleground state with 20 electoral votes. The prior 6 elections (1992 - 2016), PA as a whole voted Democrats.

In this project, our team will analyze the gender count, age of active voters, number of active vs inactive voters, count of political party affiliation (Republican, Democrat, other).
